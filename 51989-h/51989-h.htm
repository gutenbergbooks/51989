      paused in front of the great building; he looked up and hesitated and went
      in. He crossed the marble lobby and passed through the silent, swinging
      doors on the opposite side and stepped into a softly lighted café. He had
      never been in Merwin&rsquo;s before, though he had often heard of it, and he was
      curious as to what it would be like. There was a sound of music somewhere
      and low voices and the tinkle of silver and glass behind the little green
      curtains. He entered an alcove at the left and sat down. The restfulness
      of the place soothed him, and he sat listening to the distant music and
      looking out between the parted curtains of the alcove to the room with its
      little tables filling the space beyond the green-curtained alcoves on
      either side and the people seated at the tables. They were laughing and
      eating and talking and drinking from delicate cups or turning
      slender-stemmed glasses in their fingers as they talked. Beyond the tables
      rose a small platform; a woman had just mounted it and was bowing to the
      scattered tables. The sound of voices ceased an instant and hands clapped
      faintly here and there. The woman on the platform bowed again and looked
      at the accompanist, who struck the opening bars. It was a light, trivial
      song with more personality than art in the singing of it, and the audience
      applauded perfunctorily, hardly breaking off its talk to acknowledge that
      it was done. The woman stepped down from the platform and joined a group
      at a table near by, and waiters moved among the tables, refilling cups and
      glasses and taking orders.
    </p>
    <p>
      A waiter paused by the alcove where Eldridge Walcott was sitting and
      pushed back the little curtain and looked in and waited. Eldridge took up
      the card on the table before him; he fingered it a little awkwardly and
      laid it down: &ldquo;Bring me cigars,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      The waiter scribbled on a card and passed on. When he had completed the
      alcoves on the left he turned and went back along the right, pausing
      before each one and bending forward to listen and take the order on his
      card. As he approached the third alcove he pushed back the curtain that
      half concealed it at the back and bent forward. When he passed on the
      curtain did not fall into place; it remained caught on the back of the
      seat. From where Eldridge sat he could see the woman seated in the alcove.
      She was alone, her back to him, her head a little bent as if in thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      He glanced at her carelessly and along the row of green curtains to the
      tables beyond. It was all much as he had imagined it&mdash;a place where
      one could spend time and money without too much exertion. It was the money
      part of it that interested Eldridge. His client had asked him to look into
      it for him as an investment, and he had decided on this informal way of
      appraising it. To-morrow he was to go over the books and accounts. The
      owners wanted a stiff price for the goodwill. It was probably worth what
      they were asking he decided as he watched the careless, happy crowd.
      People who came here were not thinking how much they could save.... It was
      not the sort of place he should care to come to often himself. Life to
      Eldridge was a serious, drab affair compared with Merwin&rsquo;s. He liked to
      think how much he could save; and when he had saved it he liked to invest
      it where it would breed more.... He might take a few shares of the capital
      stock himself&mdash;his client had suggested it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The waiter brought the cigars and Eldridge lighted one and leaned back,
      smoking and enjoying the relaxed air of the place. He could understand
      dimly how people liked this sort of thing and would come day after day for
      music and talk and the purposelessness of it all; it was a kind of huge,
      informal club with a self-elected membership.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a prospective investor the charm of it pleased him. They ought to be
      able to make a good thing of it. He fell to making little calculations; it
      was part of his power as a successful man of business that he understood
      detail and the value of small things.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was not a financier, but he handled small interests well and he had
      built up a comfortable fortune. From being in debt before he married, he
      had advanced slowly until now his investments made a good showing. He
      could probably live on the income to-morrow if he chose.... He blew a
      little ring of smoke.... His investments and what they were mounting to
      was a kind of epic poem to Eldridge&rsquo;s slow-moving mind.... Yes&mdash;he
      would take a few shares of the café stock. He looked thoughtfully at his
      cigar and calculated how many, and what they would be worth.... The music
      had taken the form of a young boy with a violin who stood absorbed in his
      playing, a kind of quick fervor in his face and figure. The voices had
      ceased and only now and then a cup clicked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eldridge lifted his eyes from the cigar. The woman in the alcove had moved
      nearer the end of the seat and was watching the boy, her lips parted on a
      half smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cigar dropped from Eldridge&rsquo;s fingers. He stared at the woman&mdash;stared&mdash;and
      stirred vaguely.
    </p>
    <p>
      She turned a little and Eldridge reached out his hand and drew a quick
      curtain between them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through the slit he could still see the figure of the woman, her head
      thrown a little back, her eyes following the bow of music as it rose and
      fell, and the lips smiling in happy content&mdash;He drew a quick breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      Slowly a deep flush came into his face&mdash;How dared Rosalind come here!
      It was a respectable place&mdash;of course&mdash;but how dared she spend
      her time and money&mdash;his money and time that belonged to her home and
      her children&mdash;in a place like this?... Her hands were folded in her
      lap, and her eyes followed the music.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had barely touched the glass on the table before her, he noted, or the
      plate of little biscuit. She seemed to sit in a dream.... His mind
      whirled. Six hours before he had said good-by to her at the breakfast
      table&mdash;a plain, drab woman in shabby clothes, with steel-rimmed
      spectacles that looked at him with a little line between the eyes and
      reminded him that he needed to order coal for the range and a new
      clothes-line.... He had ordered the coal, but he recalled suddenly that he
      had forgotten the clothes-line; he had intended to see if he could get one
      cheaper at a wholesale place he knew of; his memory held the clothes-line
      fast in the left lobe of his brain while the grey matter of the right lobe
      whirled excitedly about the woman in the alcove.
    </p>
    <p>

    <p>
      She had raised a lorgnette to her eyes and was looking at the boy
      violinist, a little, happy, wistful smile on her lips.... Eldridge had not
      seen her smile like that for years. His left lobe abandoned the
      clothes-line and recalled to him when it was he saw the little smile, half
      wistful, half happy, on her face.... They were standing by the gate, and
      he was saying good night; the moon had just come up, and there was a
      fragrant bush beside the path that gave out the smell of spring; the left
      lobe yielded up fragrance and moonlight and the little wistful smile while
      his quick eye followed the lorgnette; it had dropped to her lap, and her
      hands were folded on it.... Rosalind&mdash;! A gold lorgnette&mdash;and
      draperies, soft, gauzy lines and folds of silk&mdash;and a hat on her
      shining, lifted hair, like a vague coronet! Eldridge Walcott held his
      cigar grimly between his teeth; the cigar had gone out&mdash;both lobes
      had ceased to whirl.... A kind of frozen light held his face. His hand
      groped for his hat. Why should he not step across the aisle and sit down
      in the chair opposite her and confront her?&mdash;the green curtains would
      shut them in.... Both lobes stared at the thought and held it tight&mdash;to
      face Rosalind, a grey, frightened woman in her finery, behind the little
      green curtains! He shook himself loose and stood up. Softly his hand drew
      back the curtain, and he stepped out. They were clapping the boy
      violinist, who had played to the end, and Eldridge moved toward the
      swinging doors and passed out and stood in the lobby. He wiped his
      forehead.... A sound of moving chairs came from behind the doors, and he
      crossed the lobby quickly and plunged into the crowd. It was five o&rsquo;clock,
      and the streets were filled with people hurrying home. Eldridge turned
      against the tide and crossed a side street and pressed east, his feet
      seeming to find a way of their own. He was not thinking where he would go&mdash;except
      that it must be away from her. He could not face her yet&mdash;Who <i>was</i>
      she? There was the drab woman of the morning, waiting for him to come home
      with the clothesline, and there was the woman of the alcove, splendid,
      gentle, with the little smile and the gold lorgnette.... Rosalind&mdash;Fifteen
      years he had lived with her, and he had known her ten years before that&mdash;there
      was nothing <i>queer</i> about Rosalind! He lifted his head a little
      proudly&mdash;The woman he had just left was very beautiful! It struck him
      for the first time that she was beautiful, and he half stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      He walked more slowly, taking it in&mdash;Rosalind was not beautiful; she
      had not been beautiful&mdash;even as a girl&mdash;only pretty, with a kind
      of freshness and freedom about her and something in her eyes that he had
      not understood&mdash;It was the look that had drawn him&mdash;He was
      always wondering about it. Sometimes he saw it in the night&mdash;as if it
      flitted when he woke. He had not thought of it for years. Something in the
      woman&rsquo;s shoulder and the line of her head was like it. But the woman was
      very <i>beautiful!</i>&mdash;Suppose it were not Rosalind after all! He
      gave a quick breath, and his feet halted and went on. Then a thought
      surged at him, and he walked fast&mdash;he almost ran. No&mdash;No&mdash;!
      It was as if he put his hands over his ears to shut it out. Other women&mdash;but
      not <i>his</i> wife! She had children&mdash;<i>three</i> children! He
      tried to think of the children to steady himself. He pictured her putting
      them to bed at night, bending above Tommie and winding a flannel bandage
      tight around his throat for croup; he could see her quite plainly, the
      quick, efficient fingers and firm, roughened hands drawing the bed-clothes
      in place and tucking them in.... The woman&rsquo;s hands had rested so quietly
      in her lap! Were they rough?&mdash;She had worn gloves&mdash;he remembered
      now&mdash;soft gloves, like the color in her gown.... He stared at the
      gloves&mdash;they were long&mdash;they came to the elbow&mdash;yes, there
      was a kind of soft, lacy stuff that fell away from them&mdash;yes, they
      were long gloves.... They must have cost&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      He tried to think what the gloves must have cost, but he had nothing to go
      by. Rosalind had never worn such gloves, nor his mother or sisters. Only
      women who were very rich wore gloves like that&mdash;or women&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      He faced the thought at last. He had come out where the salt air struck
      him; the town and its lights had fallen behind; there was the marsh to
      cross, and he was on a long beach, the wind in his face, the water rolling
      up in spray and sweeping slowly back&mdash;He strode forward, his head to
      the wind.... There was no one that she knew&mdash;no man.... How should
      she know any one that he did not know!
    </p>
    <p>
      She was never away.... But was he&mdash;sure! How did he know what went on&mdash;all
      day... half past seven till seven at night? In the evenings she mended the
      children&rsquo;s clothes and he looked over the paper. Sometimes they talked
      about things and planned how they could get along. Rosalind was a good
      manager. He saw her sitting beside the lamp, in her cheap dress, her head
      bent over the figures, working it out with him&mdash;and he saw the woman
      in the alcove&mdash;the clothes she wore&mdash;he drew back before it&mdash;more
      than the whole family spent in a year!... The gloves alone might have
      bought her Sunday suit&mdash;Sunday was, after all, the only day he knew
      where she was&mdash;in church with him and, in the afternoon, lying down
      in her room while he took the children for a walk.... He was a good father&mdash;he
      set his teeth to it defiantly, against the wind. She could not accuse <i>him</i>
      of neglect.... Suddenly a hurt feeling stirred somewhere deep down&mdash;He
      did not look at it; he did not know it was there. But the first shock had
      passed. He was not bewildered any more. He could think steadily, putting
      point to point, building up the &ldquo;case&rdquo;.... Then, suddenly, he would see
      her in the great spectacles, reminding him of the clothes-line&mdash;and
      his &ldquo;case&rdquo; collapsed like a foolish little card house.... Not Rosalind&mdash;other
      women, perhaps&mdash;but not Rosalind.... He turned slowly back, the wind
      behind him urging him on. He would go home&mdash;to her. Perhaps when he
      saw her he should know what to think.... But perhaps she had not yet come
      home. If he hurried he might get there before her and face her as she came
      in. He hurried fast, he almost ran, and when he reached the streets he
      signalled a cab; he had not used a cab for years; it would cost a dollar,
      at least&mdash;He looked out at the half-deserted street&mdash;the crowd
      had thinned. He held his watch where the light of the street arc flashed
      across it&mdash;six-thirty. Half an hour before his usual time. He paid
      the fare and went quickly up the steps.... The children were talking in
      the dining-room. There was no other sound. He opened the door and looked
      in. She was standing by the table looking at Tommie&rsquo;s coat&mdash;There was
      a rent in the shoulder and the face bent above it had a look of quiet
      patience&mdash;The grey-drab hair was parted exactly in the middle and
      combed smoothly down; the eyes behind the spectacles looked up&mdash;with
      the little line between them. When she saw who it was she glanced for a
      moment at the clock and then back at him&mdash;&ldquo;Did you bring the
      clothesline?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stared at her a moment&mdash;at her plain, cheap dress and homely face.
      Then he turned away. &ldquo;I&mdash;forgot,&rdquo; he said.

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>HEN supper was
      done and the children in bed she moved about the room for a few minutes
      putting things to rights. Eldridge, sitting by the table, held his
      newspaper in his hand and now and then he rustled it and turned it over;
      his eyes did not leave the little black printed marks, but his real eyes
      were not following the marks; they were watching the woman; they tried to
      dart upon her in her plainness and make her speak. There was something
      monstrous to him&mdash;that they should be here together, in this room&mdash;he
      could have touched her with his hand as she moved past him&mdash;yet they
      were a thousand miles apart. He cleared his throat; he would force her,
      accuse her, make her reveal what was going on behind the earnest-looking
      glasses.... He turned the paper and began another page.... If he were
      another man he might spring at her&mdash;take her by the throat&mdash;force
      her back&mdash;back against the wall&mdash;and <i>make</i> her speak! She
      had finished tidying the room and came over to the table, the torn coat in
      her hand; she was looking down at the frayed threads in the rent, the
      little line between her eyes; he did not look up or move; he could hear
      her breathing&mdash;then she gave a little sigh and laid the coat on the
      table.... She was leaving the room. His eyes leaped after her and came
      back.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she returned she spread the roll of pieces on the table and selected
      one, slipping it in beneath the rent; he could see&mdash;without taking
      his eyes from the page&mdash;he could see the anxious, faintly red
      knuckles and her fingers fitting the piece in place with deft, roughened
      tips. She had a kind of special skill at mending, making old things new.
      When they were first married it had been one of their little jokes&mdash;how
      lucky she was to have married a poor man. He had kissed her fingers one
      day&mdash;he recalled it&mdash;when she had shown him the little skilful
      darn in his coat; he had called it a kind of poem and he had kissed her.
      It seemed almost shameless to him, behind his paper&mdash;the foolishness
      was shameless&mdash;of kissing her for that....
    </p>
    <p>
      She was sewing swiftly now with the short, still movements that came and
      went like breaths; her head was bent over the coat and he could see the
      parting of her hair; he dropped his eye to it for a minute and rustled the
      paper and turned it vaguely. &ldquo;I was in at Merwin&rsquo;s this afternoon,&rdquo; he
      said.
    </p>
    <p>
      The needle paused a dart&mdash;and went on rhythmically, in and out. &ldquo;Did
      you like it?&rdquo; she asked. She had not lifted her head from her work.
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned a casual page and read on&mdash;&ldquo;Oh, so-so.&rdquo; It was the sort of
      absent-minded talk they often had&mdash;a kind of thinking out loud
      without interest in one another.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a popular place, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was smoothing the edges of the patch thoughtfully; there was a little
      smile on her lip.
    </p>
    <p>
      He folded his paper. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to bed,&rdquo; he announced.
    </p>
    <p>
      She glanced quickly at the clock and resumed her work. &ldquo;I must finish
      this. He hasn&rsquo;t any other to wear.&rdquo; The needle went in and out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eldridge rose and stretched himself above her. He looked down at her&mdash;at
      the swift-moving hands and grey closeness of her dress. He would like to
      take her in his hands and crush out of her the thoughts&mdash;make her
      speak out the thoughts that followed the swift-going needle; he did not
      know that he wanted this&mdash;he was only feeling over and over, in some
      deep, angry place&mdash;&ldquo;What the devil was she doing there? What the&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He moved about the room a minute and &rsquo;went out. The woman by the table
      sewed on. A bolt shot in the front hall and Eldridge&rsquo;s feet mounted the
      stairs slowly. Then the room was quiet&mdash;only the clock and the
      needle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently the needle stopped&mdash;the woman&rsquo;s hands lay folded in her
      lap. The figure was motionless, the head bent&mdash;only across her face
      moved the little smile.... The clock travelled round and whirred its
      warning note and struck, and she only stirred a little, as if a breath
      escaped her, and took up her work, looking at it blindly.
    </p>
    <p>
      A sound came in the hall and she looked up.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood in the doorway, his old dressing-gown wrapped around him, his
      hands gaunt, with the little hairs at the wrist uncovered by cuffs.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him, smiling absently. There was something almost beautiful
      in her face as she lifted it to him&mdash;&ldquo;When are you coming to bed?&rdquo; he
      asked harshly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, right now, Eldridge&mdash;I must have been dreaming.&rdquo; She gathered
      up the work from her lap. &ldquo;I hope I haven&rsquo;t kept you awake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stood looking at her a minute. Then he wheeled about without response.
      His feet beneath the bath gown moved awkwardly. But the spine in the bath
      gown had a cold, dignified, offended look&mdash;a kind of grotesque
      stateliness&mdash;as it disappeared through the doorway.
    </p>
    <p>
      The woman looked after it, the little, gathering smile still on her face.
      Then she turned toward the lamp and put it out, and the radiant smile
      close to the lamp became a part of the dark.

      III
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">B</span>Y morning it had
      become a dream.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eldridge was late and he hurried from the house and hurried all the
      morning to catch up. By luncheon time he was in another world. He took
      plenty of time for his luncheon; it was one of the things he had learned&mdash;to
      eat his luncheon slowly and take time to digest it. Sometimes he read the
      paper, sometimes he dropped into a moving-picture show for a few minutes
      afterward. But to-day he did neither. He sat in the restaurant&mdash;it
      was a crowded restaurant, all America coming and going&mdash;and he
      watched it idly. He had a rested, comfortable feeling, as if he had
      escaped some calamity. It seemed foolish now, as he looked back&mdash;a
      kind of fever in the blood that had twisted the commonest things into
      queer shape. He looked back over it dispassionately&mdash;it was the woman
      in Merwin&rsquo;s who had started it, of course; there <i>was</i> something
      about her&mdash;something like Rosalind&mdash;curiously like her&mdash;it
      was like what Rosalind <i>might</i> have been, more than what she was&mdash;a
      kind of spirited-up Rosalind! He smiled grimly.
    </p>
    <p>
      He called for his check; and while he waited he saw her again, the figure
      of the woman&mdash;not in the restaurant&mdash;but in a kind of vision&mdash;in
      the alcove behind the curtain, her head a little bent, her hands folded
      quietly in her lap... who <i>was</i> she&mdash;? His heart gave a sudden
      twist and stopped&mdash;He had never felt like this about&mdash;any one&mdash;had
      he? He looked down at a red check, with its stamped black figures, and
      fumbled in his pocket&mdash;and brought out a coin and laid it beside the
      check and stared at it.... The check and the coin slipped away and he
      stared at the marble top. Suppose he saw her&mdash;again... some time....
      Two coins reappeared on the table and he picked them up. Then he put back
      one and felt for his hat and went out.... The traffic shrieked at him and
      people jostled him with their elbows and hurried him, and he jostled back
      and woke up and shook off the queerness and went about his work.... He was
      forty-one years old and his property was all well invested. It had never
      occurred to him that he could be different from himself.... He read in the
      paper of people who did things&mdash;did things different from themselves,
      suddenly&mdash;people who squandered fortunes in a day, or murdered and
      ran away from business&mdash;and their wives&mdash;people who committed
      suicide. Vicariously, he knew all about how queer men could be... and his
      chief experience with it all, with this world that his newspaper rolled
      before him every day, was a kind of wonder that people would do such
      things and a knowledge, deeper than faith or conviction, that Eldridge
      Walcott would never do any of them. He explained such men&mdash;if he
      explained them at all&mdash;by saying that they must have a screw loose
      somewhere. Perhaps he thought of men, vaguely, as put together with works
      inside, carefully adjusted and screwed in place, warranted, with good
      usage, to run so long; certainly it had not occurred to him that a man
      could change much after he was forty years old.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went back to business refreshed, more refreshed than his luncheon often
      left him. He thought of Rosalind, now and then, with a kind of
      thankfulness&mdash;Rosalind waiting for him at night with the children,
      life moving on in the same comfortable way. He had even a moment&rsquo;s flash
      of thankfulness to the unknown woman that she had made him see how
      comfortable he was, how much he had to be thankful for in his quiet life.
      It was a profitable afternoon&mdash;the best stroke of business in six
      months; and he flattered himself that he handled it well. He felt
      unusually alive, alert. On the way home he passed a florist&rsquo;s and half
      stopped, looking down at a beautiful plant that flamed on a bench outside
      the door; he did not know what it was; they were all &ldquo;plants&rdquo; to him,
      except roses&mdash;he knew a rose&mdash;this was not a rose; he looked at
      it a moment and hurried on.... She would think it strange if he brought
      her anything like a plant.
    </p>
    <p>
      The idea grew with him the next day and the next. Why should he not give
      her something? She deserved it. There seemed always some good reason why
      her clothes were the last to be bought and the plainest and shabbiest&mdash;and
      a woman&rsquo;s clothes could always be made over.... Suppose she had a new suit&mdash;something
      that was really good&mdash;Suppose he got it for her&mdash;would she be in
      the least like that&mdash;other&mdash;one&mdash;? He had long ago
      abandoned the idea that there was a real resemblance between them. He knew
      now that he must have been overwrought, excited in some mysterious way&mdash;the
      woman herself seemed to have excited him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wrong that he had done Rosalind&mdash;even in his thought&mdash;made
      him tender of her. He did not buy a crimson flower to take home to her.
      But a week later he called one day at his bank and in the evening he
      handed her a little, twisted roll of something.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had finished her work and was sitting for a minute before she brought
      her sewing basket. He laid the roll in the curve of her fingers in her
      lap.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she glanced down at it she took it up in short-sighted surprise and
      looked at the new, crisp bills&mdash;and then at him&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      He nodded. &ldquo;For you,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a new suit&mdash;you need it.&rdquo; He
      balanced a little on his toes, looking down at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her face flushed red; it grew from neck to chin and flooded up to him.
      &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; she said under her breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want you to get a good one&mdash;good stuff, good dressmaker&mdash;It&rsquo;s
      enough, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is more&mdash;than enough&mdash;&rdquo; The red had flooded her face again&mdash;as
      if she would cry. But she said nothing for a minute. She was looking down
      at the bills.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she looked up. The plain face had a smile like light from somewhere
      far away. &ldquo;May I get just what I like&mdash;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He nodded proudly. She was almost beautiful... perhaps&mdash;in the new
      gown&mdash;He pulled himself together.... She had looked down again and
      was fingering the bills happily.... &ldquo;There is a little muff and fur&mdash;&rdquo;
       she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      He nodded, encouraging&mdash;&ldquo;A muff and fur and a little fur cap that I
      wanted&mdash;so much&mdash;for Mary&mdash;and overcoats for the boys&mdash;they&rsquo;re
      so shabby&mdash;and your hat is really not fit, you know&mdash;&rdquo; She was
      looking up now and smiling and checking them off&mdash;He stopped her with
      a gesture.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are to spend it on yourself,&rdquo; he said almost harshly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On myself&mdash;! Why do you say that?&rdquo; She almost confronted him&mdash;as
      if she caught her breath&mdash;&ldquo;You never have things and you always get
      out of spending things on yourself.&rdquo; He half muttered the words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh&mdash;oh&mdash;! I shall get something for myself. You will see!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He held out his hand. He was a good man of business. No one got far ahead
      of him.&mdash;&ldquo;When you have bought the dress I will pay for it,&rdquo; he said.
      &ldquo;Give them to me. I cannot trust you with them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him&mdash;and at the bills&mdash;and they dropped from her
      hand into his slowly and her arms fell; her shoulders rose and trembled
      and the hands covered her face. She was weeping, deep, silent sobs&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>

      <a href="images/0057.jpg"><img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      He bent over her&mdash;ashamed. &ldquo;You must not do that,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You
      needn&rsquo;t feel bad. I wanted you to have it&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She took down her hands and looked at him. &ldquo;It seemed so good to have&mdash;enough&mdash;more
      than enough! to be extravagant!&rdquo; She threw out her hands with a little
      wasteful gesture.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was looking at her closely. A suspicion leaped at him. Her face was so
      free and the tears had made it mysterious and sweet&mdash;she was as
      wonderful as that other&mdash;she was&mdash;She was&mdash;He stopped with
      a quick jerk. &ldquo;I want you to be extravagant on <i>yourself!</i>&rdquo; he said.
      He was watching her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      It flamed again but it did not drop before him. Only the eyes sent back a
      look&mdash;on guard, it seemed to him. &ldquo;I do not need so much for myself,&rdquo;
       she said quietly, &ldquo;part of it will be quite enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He put the bills in his pocket. &ldquo;All or nothing,&rdquo; he said easily.
    </p>

    </p>
    <p>
      All the next day he turned it in his mind&mdash;the look in her eyes, the
      beauty&mdash;something deep within her, shining out.... He no longer went
      peacefully about his work. <i>Could</i> it have been Rosalind, after
      all?... He had never seen her look like that&mdash;he had not dreamed....
      But when he came home at night the look was not there; he fancied that she
      was more worn and a little troubled. Certainly, no one could think of her
      as beautiful... and why should a man want to think his wife beautiful?...
      It was the woman in the alcove that had done the mischief. He should never
      get over the woman in the alcove. She had got into his life whether or
      not. He could not be comfortable about Rosalind. There was something about
      her that he had not known or suspected before. He fell to watching her
      when she was not aware. He had thought he knew her so well and now she was
      a stranger.... But perhaps it was himself&mdash;the woman had done
      something to him. Rosalind was the same&mdash;but was she? He looked at
      her a long time one night as she lay asleep. The moonlight had come in and
      was on her face. He watched it&mdash;as if a breath might speak to him&mdash;it
      was not Rosalind&rsquo;s face. Some stranger was there, out of a strange land; a
      great yearning came to him to waken her, to ask her whence she came, what
      it was that she knew&mdash;what made her face so peaceful in the moonlight&mdash;calling
      to him? He got up softly and closed the blind. He remembered he had heard
      that it was not good for people to sleep with the moon shining on them&mdash;it
      was only superstition, of course. But superstition had suddenly changed
      its bounds for him.... Were there things, perhaps, that people knew, that
      they guessed&mdash;true things that they could not explain and did not
      talk about?...

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">H</span>E could not bring
      himself to speak to Rosalind about the woman in the alcove. He wanted to
      speak&mdash;to do away, once for all, with the strangeness and the spell
      she seemed to have cast about him, to speak of her casually as that woman
      I saw the other day at Merwin&rsquo;s; but he could not do it. It was as if he
      were afraid&mdash;or bashful. He had not felt like this since&mdash;not
      since he was in love&mdash;with Rosalind! He looked at the thought and
      turned it over slowly. He was not in love with the woman&mdash;certainly
      he was not in love with her! He would not know her again if he met her on
      the street.... Would he not! Suddenly he felt that he had known her always&mdash;longer

      mind travelled out into space&mdash;great stars swung away mistily&mdash;what
      did it mean&mdash;all his world and stars?... Perhaps if he saw her again,
      just a few minutes, he would feel like himself again.... It was worth
      trying&mdash;and how he wanted&mdash;to&mdash;see her! Well, what of that?
      There was nothing wrong in being curious about a woman like that. If she
      <i>had</i> some uncanny power over him he might as well find it out&mdash;fight
      it!
    </p>
    <p>
      He was respectable&mdash;he was a married man.... And what had Rosalind to
      do with it? Perhaps it <i>was</i> Rosalind. He should never quiet down
      till he knew. There was something in his blood. The next time he was
      passing Merwin&rsquo;s he would go in....
    </p>
    <p>
      He passed Merwin&rsquo;s that afternoon&mdash;and went in. But she was not
      there. He sat a little while in the quiet of the place, looking across to
      the alcove where the woman had been. There was no one in it and the
      curtains were drawn back. Each time a stir came from the swinging doors or
      a dress rustled beside him he half turned and held his breath till it
      passed and took its place at one of the little tables or in an alcove. But
      the third alcove on the right remained empty. No quiet figure moved with
      soft grace and seated itself there... no one but Eldridge saw the figure&mdash;the
      gentle, bending line of the neck, the little droop of the face.... If only
      she would lift it or turn to him a minute.... And then the still, clear
      emptiness of the place swept between; the green curtains framed it, as if
      it were a picture, a little antechamber leading somewhere....
    </p>
    <p>
      Eldridge shook himself and took his hat and went out. The doors swung
      silently behind him&mdash;he would never go in there again! He was a fool&mdash;a
      soft fool! Then he almost stopped in the crowd of the street.... And he
      knew suddenly that he would go back. He would go&mdash;again and again&mdash;he
      could not help himself. But he was <i>not</i> in love&mdash;he had been in
      love&mdash;with Rosalind&mdash;and it was not like this.... A policeman
      thrust out an arm and stopped him, and he waited for the traffic to stream
      past.... He was not in love&mdash;only curious about the woman; it teased
      him not to know who she was... and why he had been so sure that she was
      Rosalind. If he could see her again&mdash;just a minute&mdash;long enough
      to make sure, he would not care if he never saw her again. He was loyal,
      of course, to Rosalind, more loyal than he had ever been. It seemed
      curious how the woman had made him see Rosalind&mdash;all the plainness of
      her filled with something strange and sweet&mdash;like moonlight or a
      quiet place.

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HE next day he
      went again to Merwin&rsquo;s. No use for him to say he would keep away. He knew,
      all through the drudging accounts in the morning, that he would go; and
      while he talked with clients and arranged sales and managed a real-estate
      deal&mdash;back in the corner of his mind, behind its green curtains, the
      little alcove waited.
    </p>
    <p>
      He passed through the swinging doors and glanced quickly, and the hand
      holding his hat gripped it tight. The curtains of the third alcove to the
      right were half closed, but along the floor lay a fold of grey dress and
      over the end of the seat, thrown carelessly back, hung the edge of a
      fur-lined wrap.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eldridge turned blindly toward his place. Some one was there. He had to
      take the alcove behind, and he could not see her from the alcove behind&mdash;not
      even if she should push back the curtain that shut her away&mdash;But he
      found himself, strangely, not caring to see her.... She was there, a
      little way off; it was she&mdash;no need to part the curtains and look in
      on her. He felt her presence through all the place. He was no longer
      guilty.... He was hardly curious to know her. He took up the card from the
      table before him and studied it blindly.... His heart seemed to lie out
      before him&mdash;a clear, white place.... Men and women were not so evil
      as he had dreamed. He was doing something that a week ago he would have
      condemned any one for; yet his heart, as he looked into it, was singularly
      clear and big&mdash;and the light shining in it puzzled him&mdash;like a
      charm&mdash;It was a place that he had never seen; he had dreamed of it,
      perhaps, as a child. He ordered something, at random, from the card and
      moved nearer the aisle.... No, he could not see her&mdash;only the fold of
      her dress and the bit of grey fur. He was glad she was warmly dressed. The
      weather was keener to-day. He must get Rosalind a wrap&mdash;something
      warm like that and lined with fur&mdash;soft and grey and deep. Everything
      the woman had he would like Rosalind to have&mdash;perhaps it might atone&mdash;a
      little&mdash;for the light in his heart. He had not felt like this for
      Rosalind.... But how should they have known. They were only a boy and girl&mdash;and
      some moonlight.... And all the time this other woman was waiting&mdash;somewhere....
      No one had told him. If some one had said to him: &ldquo;Wait, she is coming&mdash;you
      must wait!&rdquo; But no one knew, no one had told him.... Did <i>she</i> know,
      across there in her place, did she know&mdash;had she waited&mdash;for
      him? He stirred a little. Some one might be with her now; or she might be
      waiting for some one. But he could not go to her.... And yet&mdash;why not&mdash;?&mdash;He
      had only to cross the aisle&mdash;and put back the curtains&mdash;and look
      at her.... He shook himself and lifted his glass and drank grimly. He was
      a lawyer; his name was Eldridge Walcott; he lived in a brick house and he
      had children&mdash;three children&mdash;<i>That</i> was the real world;
      this other thing was&mdash;madness.... So this was the way men felt! This
      was it, was it&mdash;very clean and whole&mdash;as if life were beginning
      for them&mdash;they had made mistakes, but they would try again; they saw
      something bigger and better than they had ever known&mdash;and they
      reached out to it. Men were not wicked, as he had thought&mdash;It was a
      strange world where you had to be wicked to do things&mdash;like this!...
      And there might be some one with her now! Under the voices and the music
      he fancied he could hear them talking in low tones; their voices seemed to
      come and go vaguely; half guessed, not constant, but quiet and happy....
      Or was it his own heart that beat to her&mdash;the words it could
      speak?... He would not speak to her&mdash;but he would not go away.... He
      would wait till she moved back the curtain and stepped out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he half remembered something&mdash;and looked at his watch&mdash;he
      had promised Rosalind to wait for the boys and take them to the dentist&rsquo;s.
      She had said she could not go this afternoon and he had promised to wait
      at the office; he had not meant to come here.... He slipped back the watch
      and stood up and hesitated&mdash;and turned away. He might never see her
      now. Well, he had promised Rosalind. Somehow, the promise to Rosalind must
      be kept&mdash;now. The letter of the law must be kept!
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      They were waiting for him in the hall by his office door, sitting at the
      top of the flight of stairs and peering down into the elevator-shaft as
      the elevator shot up and down. He saw them as he stepped out, and smiled
      at them. They were fresh, wholesome boys, and he had a sense, as he fitted
      the key in the lock and they stood waiting behind his bent back, that they
      belonged to him. He had always thought of them as Rosalind&rsquo;s boys!
    </p>
    <p>
      He threw open the door and they went in, looking about them almost shyly;
      they were not shy boys, but father was a big man&mdash;and they looked at
      the place where he worked.... Some time they would be&mdash;men and have
      an office....
    </p>
    <p>
      Eldridge Walcott turned back from the desk that he had opened. He had
      taken out a little roll of paper and slipped it into his pocket. Their
      eyes followed him gravely. He looked at them standing&mdash;half in their
      world, half in his&mdash;and smiled to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You had to wait a good while, didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      They nodded together. &ldquo;Most an hour,&rdquo; said Tommie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s all right&mdash;Something kept me. Come on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When they reached home that evening he handed the little roll of paper he
      had taken from the desk to Rosalind. &ldquo;I have doubled it,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There will be enough for everything you want.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For a minute she did not speak. Then she took it. &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; she said
      slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want you to get a suit, you know&mdash;a good one&mdash;&rdquo; He paused. &ldquo;&mdash;And
      you need something warm&mdash;a fur-lined wrap or something&mdash;don&rsquo;t
      you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She wrinkled the little line between her eyes. &ldquo;It is&mdash;so late&mdash;the
      winter is half gone already.&rdquo; Then her face cleared. &ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ll&mdash;wait
      till spring,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      He could almost fancy something danced at him, mocked him behind the still
      face.
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned away, the deep, hurt feeling coming close. &ldquo;Get what you like,&rdquo;
       he said. &ldquo;I want you to have enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The money lay in her hand, and her fingers opened on it and closed on it.
      Then she breathed softly, like a sigh, and went to her desk and put it
      away.

    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HROUGH the weeks
      that followed Eldridge watched the things money could buy quietly taking
      their place in the house. Little comforts that he had not missed&mdash;had
      not known any one could miss&mdash;were at hand. The children looked
      somehow subtly different. He had a sense of expansion, softly breaking
      threads of habit, expectancy. Only Rosalind seemed unchanged. Yet each
      time he looked at her he fancied that she <i>had</i> changed&mdash;more
      than all of them. He could not keep his eyes from her. Something was
      hidden in her&mdash;Something he did not know&mdash;that he would never
      know. Perhaps he should die and not know it.... Did the dead know things&mdash;everything?
      He seemed to remember hazily from Sunday-school&mdash;something&mdash;If
      he were dead, he might come close to her&mdash;as close as the little
      thoughts behind her eyes&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      The cold grew keener, and Eldridge, shivering home from the office,
      remembered a pair of fur gloves in the attic. He had not worn them for
      years. But after supper he took a light and went to look for them.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was cold there, in the attic, and he shivered a little, looking about
      the dusty place. There were boxes stacked along under the eaves and
      garments hanging grotesquely from the beams. He knew where Rosalind kept
      the gloves; he had seen them one day last summer when he was looking for
      window netting. It had not seemed to him then, in the hot attic, that any
      one could ever need gloves. He set down the lamp on a box and drew out a
      trunk and looked in it; they were not there. She must have changed the
      place of things&mdash;he would have to go down and ask her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then his eye sought out a box pushed far back under the eaves&mdash;he did
      not remember that he had ever seen that box; he glanced at it&mdash;and
      half turned away to pick up the lamp&mdash;and turned back. He could not
      have told why he felt that he must open it. He had set the light on a box
      a little above him, and it glimmered down on the box that he drew out and
      opened&mdash;and on a smooth piece of tissue-paper under the cover&mdash;&mdash;A
      faint perfume came from beneath the paper, and he lifted it. There was a
      pair of long grey gloves&mdash;with the shape of a woman&rsquo;s hand still
      softly held in the finger-tips.... He lifted them and stared and moistened
      his lips and ran his hand down inside the box to the bottom&mdash;soft,
      filmy stuff that yielded and sprang back.... He kneeled before it, half on
      his heels, peering down. He bent forward and lifted the things out&mdash;white
      things with threaded ribbon and lace&mdash;things such as Eldridge Walcott
      had never seen&mdash;delicate, web-like things&mdash;then a fur-lined coat
      and a grey dress and, at the bottom, a little linked something. He lifted
      it and peered at it and at the coins shining through the meshes and
      dropped it back.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood up and looked about him vaguely... after a minute he shivered a
      little. It was very cold in the attic. He knelt down and tried to put the
      things back; but his fingers shook, and the things took queer shapes and
      fell apart, and a soft perfume came from them that confused him. He tried
      to steady himself&mdash;he began at the bottom, putting each thing
      carefully in place... smoothing it down.
    </p>
    <p>
      The door below creaked. A voice listened.... &ldquo;You up there, Eldridge?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He straightened himself... out of a thousand thoughts and questions.
      &ldquo;Where are my fur gloves?&rdquo; he said quietly. He took the light from its box
      and came over to the stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her face, lifted to him, was in the light and he could see the rays of
      light falling on it&mdash;and on the stillness, like a pool....
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They&rsquo;re in the black trunk,&rdquo; said Rosalind. Her foot moved to the stair&mdash;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
      get them for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;Don&rsquo;t come up,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s cold here. I know&mdash;I was
      just looking there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So she went back, closing the door behind her to keep out the cold.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Eldridge came down he did not look at her. He blew out the light and
      put the gloves with his hat in the hall and came over with his paper and
      sat down.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was standing by the fire, bending over a pair of socks that she had
      been washing out. She was hanging them in front of the fire, pulling out
      the toes. Her eyes looked at him inquiringly as her fingers went on
      stretching the little toes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you find them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; He opened his paper slowly. She went on fussing at the socks, a
      little, absent smile on her face. &ldquo;If it keeps on like this I must get
      heavier flannels for them,&rdquo; she said. The look in her face was very sweet
      as she bent over the small socks.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked up&mdash;and glanced away. &ldquo;Money enough&mdash;have you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes&mdash;plenty of money. I will get them to-morrow&mdash;if I can
      go in to town&mdash;&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      His mind flashed to the attic above them and to the quiet alcove with the
      little green curtains that shut it off. &ldquo;Better dress warm if you do go,&rdquo;
       he said carelessly. &ldquo;It is pretty cold, you know.&rdquo; He took up the paper
      and stared at it.

    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">S</span>O it was&mdash;Rosalind!
      He sat in his office and stared at the blotter on his desk.... It was a
      green blotter&mdash;&mdash;-For years after Eldridge Walcott could not see
      a green blotter without a little, sudden sense of upheaval; he would walk
      into a plain commercial office&mdash;suddenly the walls hovered, the
      furniture moved subtly&mdash;even the floor grew a little unsteady before
      he could come with a jerk to a green blotter on the roller-top desk&mdash;and
      face it squarely. The blotter on his own desk was exchanged for a crimson
      one&mdash;the next day. He would have liked to change everything in the
      room. The very furniture seemed to mock him&mdash;to question....
    </p>
    <p>
      So it was&mdash;Rosalind! Rosalind&mdash;was like that&mdash;! His heart
      gave a quick beat&mdash;like a boy&rsquo;s&mdash;and stood still.... Rosalind
      was like that&mdash;for&mdash;somebody else.... He stared at the blotter
      and drew a pad absently toward him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The office boy stuck his head in the door and drew it back. He shook it at
      a short, heavy man with a thinnish, black-grey beard who was hovering
      near. &ldquo;He told me not to disturb him&mdash;not for anybody,&rdquo; the boy said
      importantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man took a card from his pocket and wrote on it. &ldquo;Take him that.&rdquo; The
      boy glanced at the name and at the thin, blackish beard. There was a large
      wart on the man&rsquo;s chin where the beard did not grow. The boy&rsquo;s eyes rested
      on it&mdash;and looked away to the card. &ldquo;I &rsquo;ll&mdash;ask him&mdash;&rdquo; he
      said.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man nodded. &ldquo;Take him that first.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The boy went in.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man walked to the window and looked down; the thick flesh at the back
      of his neck overlapped a little on the collar of his well-cut coat and the
      heavy shoulders seemed to shrug themselves under the smooth fit.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boy&rsquo;s eyes surveyed the back respectfully. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re to come in,&rdquo; he
      says.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man turned and went in and Eldridge Walcott looked up. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry to
      have kept you waiting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right.&rdquo; The man sat down a little heavily&mdash;as if he were
      tired. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right. I waited because I wanted to see you. I want
      some one to do&mdash;a piece of work&mdash;for me&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care to have my regular man on it&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have Clarkson, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;I have Clarkson.&rdquo; The man waited. &ldquo;Clarkson&rsquo;s all right&mdash;for
      business,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I want a different sort&mdash;for this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He felt in the pocket of his coat and drew out a letter, and then another,
      and held them, looking down at them absently, turning them over in his
      hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a divorce&mdash;&rdquo; he said. He went on turning the letters in his
      hand but not looking at them. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve waited as long as I could,&rdquo; he added
      after a minute. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s no use&mdash;&rdquo; He laid the letters on the desk. &ldquo;It
      took a detective&mdash;and money&mdash;to get &rsquo;em. I reckon they&rsquo;ll do the
      business,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eldridge reached out his hand for them. The man&rsquo;s errand startled him a
      little. He had been going over divorce on the green blotter when the boy
      came in. He opened the letters slowly. A little faint perfume drifted up&mdash;and
      between him and the words came a sense of the blackish-grey beard and the
      wart in among it. He had stared at it, fascinated, while the man
      talked.... He could imagine what it might mean to a woman, day after day.
      He focussed his attention on the letter&mdash;and read it and took up the
      other and laid it down....
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;Those are sufficient,&rdquo; he said almost curtly. He took up his
      pen. &ldquo;Your middle initial is J?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gordon J.,&rdquo; said the man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eldridge traced the name. &ldquo;And your wife?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man stared at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Her full name&mdash;&rdquo; said Eldridge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Her name is Cordelia Rose&mdash;Barstow,&rdquo; said the man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eldridge wrote it efficiently. &ldquo;Do you name any one as co-respondent?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I name&mdash;his name is&mdash;&rdquo; The man gulped and his puffy face was
      grim. &ldquo;John E. Tower is his name,&rdquo; he said slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eldridge filled in the paper before him and laid a blotter across it.
      &ldquo;That is sufficient. I will file the application to-morrow. There will be
      no trouble. She will not contest it&mdash;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man swallowed a little. &ldquo;No&mdash;She wants&mdash;to be free&mdash;&rdquo;
       He ended the words defiantly, but with a kind of shame.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eldridge made no reply. He was seeing a quiet figure, with bent head,
      smiling at something&mdash;something that shut him out. He looked across
      to the man.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man&rsquo;s eyes met his. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all you need&mdash;is it?&rdquo; He seemed a
      little disappointed. &ldquo;No more to it than this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all,&rdquo; said Eldridge.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the man did not get up. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how it happened,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You
      see, I never guessed&mdash;not till two weeks&mdash;ten days ago or so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;d always trusted Cordelia&mdash;I hadn&rsquo;t ever thought as she could do
      anything like that&mdash;not <i>my</i> wife!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One doesn&rsquo;t usually expect it of one&rsquo;s&mdash;own wife.&rdquo; Eldridge laughed
      a little, but it was not unkindly, and the man seemed to draw toward him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never mentioned it&mdash;except to that detective, and I didn&rsquo;t tell
      him&mdash;any more than I had to&mdash;He didn&rsquo;t seem to need much telling&mdash;&rdquo;
       he said dryly. &ldquo;He seemed to sense just about what had been going on&mdash;without
      telling.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;?&rdquo; Eldridge was looking thoughtfully into the greyish-black
      beard with the round lump in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s got the facts. It took him just two weeks&mdash;to get &rsquo;em.&rdquo; His
      hand motioned toward the letters, but there was something in the face&mdash;a
      kind of puffy appeal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eldridge nodded. &ldquo;They know what to do,&rdquo; he said quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hadn&rsquo;t even mistrusted,&rdquo; said the man. His eyes were looking at
      something that Eldridge could not see&mdash;something that seemed to come
      from a faint perfume in the room.... &ldquo;I can see it plain enough now&mdash;looking
      back.... You don&rsquo;t mind my telling you&mdash;a little&mdash;about it.&rdquo;
       Eldridge shook his head. The man seemed a kind of lumbering boy, yet he
      was a shrewd, keen man in business.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It might help&mdash;you know&mdash;&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I thought you&rsquo;d ask me,
      probably&mdash;I&rsquo;d kind of planned to tell you, I guess.&rdquo; He laughed a
      little awkwardly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go ahead,&rdquo; said Eldridge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was <i>my</i> friend, you see. And I brought him home with me and made
      &rsquo;em friends.... I can see now, looking back, what a fool I was&mdash;about
      it. But I didn&rsquo;t see it&mdash;then. I don&rsquo;t know now what it was about
      him.... He&rsquo;s old as I be&mdash;and I&rsquo;ve got the money. I can give her
      everything she wants&mdash;more than he can. But I know now that from the
      first day she see him she was curious about him.... I&rsquo;d brought him home
      to dinner one night&mdash;It was just after we were married.... I always
      kind of think of him that night&mdash;the way he looked at table&mdash;he&rsquo;s
      tall&mdash;You know him&mdash;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Eldridge nodded. He was seeing the tall, distinguished figure&mdash;and
      beside it a humped-up one across his desk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We had red lamp-shades and candles and flowers&mdash;Everything shining,
      you know&mdash;Cordelia likes &rsquo;em that way.... When I try to think how it
      started I see &rsquo;em the way they looked that first night. I was proud of &rsquo;em
      both. I felt as if Cordelia belonged to me&mdash;and as if he did, too&mdash;in
      a way&mdash;&rdquo; He looked at Eldridge. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d put him on to a good thing in
      business&mdash;!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He and Cordelia laughed and talked the whole evening&mdash;kind o&rsquo; took
      it up&mdash;back and forth&mdash;the way you&rsquo;d play ball. I could see
      Cordelia liked him. I was a fool. I&rsquo;d waited about getting married till I
      had money enough to give a woman&mdash;to give her everything&mdash;and
      when she&rsquo;d got it I never see there might be&mdash;something else she&rsquo;d
      want.... I don&rsquo;t just know what now&mdash;&rdquo; He shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some days, since I&rsquo;ve got sure of it, I&rsquo;ve felt as if it <i>couldn&rsquo;t</i>
      be so&mdash;as if she couldn&rsquo;t have gone on living with me and having that
      other life&mdash;I didn&rsquo;t know about&mdash;shut away from me&mdash;and I
      loving her....&rdquo; The little, clear alcove moved before Eldridge and moved
      away. He was making absent marks on the edge of the pad before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man sighed. &ldquo;Well&mdash;It isn&rsquo;t any use! That&rsquo;s all, I guess&mdash;&rdquo;
       Eldridge looked up. &ldquo;Had you thought of&mdash;winning her back?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man shook his head. &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t do it.&rdquo; He looked at him as if
      wondering whether he would understand. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s something about her I
      don&rsquo;t get at,&rdquo; he said slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t there something about any woman you don&rsquo;t get at?&rdquo; said Eldridge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s it!&rdquo; assented the man. &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t just Cordelia. It&rsquo;s all of them&mdash;in
      back of &rsquo;em, somehow. I can&rsquo;t tell you just how it is, but I&rsquo;ve thought of
      it a lot&mdash;I guess there isn&rsquo;t anything I haven&rsquo;t thought of&mdash;since
      I knew&mdash;lying awake nights and thinking. Somehow, I knew, the first
      day it came to me&mdash;I knew there wasn&rsquo;t any use... since the day I
      come on &rsquo;em at Merwin&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The lawyer&rsquo;s hand, making its little marks, stopped&mdash;and went on.
      &ldquo;They were at Merwin&rsquo;s&mdash;together?&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everybody goes to Merwin&rsquo;s,&rdquo; said the man. &ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t their being there;
      it was the way they looked when I saw &rsquo;em.... They were sitting in one of
      them little alcove places, you know&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Eldridge nodded. Yes&mdash;he knew.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The curtains were open&mdash;wide open,&rdquo; said the man. &ldquo;Anybody could &rsquo;a&rsquo;
      looked in. There wasn&rsquo;t anything wrong about it. But I saw their faces&mdash;both
      of &rsquo;em&mdash;and I knew.... They were just sitting quiet&mdash;the way
      people do when they&rsquo;re alone.... There&rsquo;s something different about the way
      people sit&mdash;when they&rsquo;re alone&mdash;by themselves&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know
      as you&rsquo;ve ever noticed it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have noticed it,&rdquo; said Eldridge. &ldquo;Quiet and happy&mdash;&rdquo; said the man,
      &ldquo;and not talking&mdash;and not needing to talk.&rdquo; He took up his hat. &ldquo;Well&mdash;you
      know where to find me. I shan&rsquo;t bother you like this again&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
       He stood up.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eldridge held out a hand. &ldquo;I am glad you told me. It helps&mdash;to
      understand&mdash;the case.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man&rsquo;s thick face looked at him. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand it myself,&rdquo; he
      said, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;ve got to go through with it.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      VIII
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">E</span>LDRIDGE went on
      making little marks on the edge of the paper. He no longer stared at the
      blotter; he was seeing things. Gordon Barstow&rsquo;s recital had shown things
      to him in perspective and his own trouble seemed moved far away from him
      to a kind of clear place. He sat and looked at it&mdash;making little
      marks on the paper. Rosalind was not to blame. A woman like Rosalind had
      the right&mdash;she could do what she wanted! What had <i>he</i> ever done
      to win her&mdash;to keep her? Not even money. He had kept it for himself&mdash;and
      built up a comfortable fortune.... He had the fortune&mdash;yes. And he
      had lost Rosalind.... He suddenly saw himself in the clear light&mdash;he
      was not lovable like old Barstow. The vision grew before him&mdash;all his
      saving closeness, his dulness&mdash;a lifeless prig!... And then the
      picture of Rosalind, the vision of her in her alcove&mdash;&ldquo;the way people
      sit when they are alone&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know as you ever noticed&mdash;?&rdquo;
       old Barstow had said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, then&mdash;what was to be done? His shoulders squared a little. No
      man was going to win Rosalind&mdash;without a fight! The man who would win
      her should reckon with him.... He had never known Rosalind. Perhaps
      Rosalind had never known him.... What had he given her&mdash;to know him
      by? She had had the right to work for him, to sweep his floors and make
      his bed and take care of the children... She should have money now. She
      should become a partner&mdash;in all his plans&mdash;and suddenly
      El-dridge Walcott saw that money would not win her&mdash;money would not
      buy the gracious presence in the alcove; she did not need money.... He
      must give his soul&mdash;to win her&mdash;Then he took out his soul and
      looked at it&mdash;the shrunken, dry, rattling thing&mdash;and flicked it
      from him with a finger-nail.
    </p>
    <p>
      The office boy put his head in cautiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo; said Eldridge harshly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Mr. Dutton,&rdquo; said the boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, show him in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And while Mr. Dutton talked of real estate, Eldridge&rsquo;s soul peeped out at
      the man. He wanted to stop the flow of facts and figures and put a
      straight question to him. &ldquo;How do you get on with your wife, Mr. Dutton?&rdquo;
       he wanted to say to him. He could see the man&rsquo;s startled face checked in
      its flow of fact.... It would not do; of course it would not do to ask him
      how he got on with his wife. Probably he got on with her as Eldridge
      Walcott had done&mdash;sewing, sweeping, eating, saving&mdash;&ldquo;So I have
      decided,&rdquo; the man was saying, &ldquo;to take the entire block&mdash;if the title
      is good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Eldridge Walcott bowed him out and turned back from the door. But he did
      not sit down. He would go to Merwin&rsquo;s. Perhaps she was there&mdash;she had
      said she might come in to town.... But, with his hand on the door, he
      paused&mdash;&mdash;Suppose he found her&mdash;What then?&mdash;and the
      man with her? What then?&mdash;Suppose he found her! There was nothing he
      could do&mdash;not yet! He would win her back.... But the man he had to
      reckon with was not the man sitting with her now, perhaps, in the alcove.
      The man he had to reckon with was Eldridge Walcott&mdash;the little,
      shrunken, undersized Eldridge Walcott.
    </p>
    <p>
      He saw it&mdash;standing with his hand on the door, looking down&mdash;and
      he looked at it a long minute.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he opened the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      The office boy wheeled about from the window-shade that was stuck halfway
      up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am ready to see anybody that comes, Burton,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said the boy. &ldquo;This old thing gets stuck every other day!&rdquo; He
      jerked at it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eldridge came across and looked at the cord and straightened it and went
      back to his room. The little incident strengthened him subtly. He had
      never yet failed in anything he undertook, big or little&mdash;he had
      always succeeded in what he undertook&mdash;And suddenly he saw that
      Eldridge Walcott had never in his life undertaken anything that was not
      small.... He had done small, safe things. He had straightened
      window-shades all his life&mdash;and he had never failed!
    </p>
    <p>
      He had always had a half-veiled contempt for men who ran risks. Find a
      safe thing and hold on to it had been his policy. It had brought him
      through smugly. He had never made a mistake.... The nearest he had ever
      come to a risk was before he asked Rosalind to marry him. There had been
      something about her that he could not fathom, something that drew him&mdash;and
      made him afraid&mdash;a kind of sweet mystery... that would not let him be
      safe. Then it had seemed so safe afterward; they had lived together
      quietly without a break. The young Rosalind who had taught him to be
      afraid he had forgotten&mdash;and now young Rosalind had come back... she
      had come back to him and with deeper mystery.... This was the real
      Rosalind, the other was only a shadowy promise.... The young Rosalind
      would try him for his soul&mdash;and he had&mdash;no soul!
    </p>
    <p>
      Who was that other man in the alcove with her&mdash;the man who had won
      her? Who was it she had found to understand the mystery&mdash;to look up
      to her and worship her&mdash;as he had worshipped Rosalind, the girl; as
      he had worshipped Rosalind&mdash;and let her go!
    </p>
    <p>
      And he had been thinking about divorce! Thinking of the grounds for it and
      how he should get grounds of divorce&mdash;as Gordon Barstow had done. He
      glanced at the two letters on his desk and at the little, jotted notes of
      the Barstow case and a smile flitted to them&mdash;grounds for divorce
      from Rosalind! He saw her, in her freedom, moving from him.... His teeth
      set a little. She should never leave him! She should stay with him. She
      should stay because he wanted her&mdash;and because she wanted him!
    </p>
    <p>
      And through the rest of the day, as clients came and went, he saw
      something new. He saw cases differently. Men were accustomed to come to
      him because he was a &ldquo;safe&rdquo; man.... Well, he was not quite safe to-day&mdash;But
      he knew underneath, as he worked, that his advice had never been so worth
      while.

    <h2>
      IX
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">H</span>E had left the
      office early and had caught a car that was passing the corner as he came
      out. As soon as he entered he knew that Rosalind was in the car, three
      seats ahead. He gave a little start, a quick flash&mdash;he did not want
      to catch Rosalind off guard&mdash;Then he smiled; it was not Rosalind of
      the alcove&mdash;it was the plain, every-day Rosalind, her lap heaped with
      bundles, and bundles on the seat beside her. Rosalind&rsquo;s flannels, he
      thought, probably.
    </p>
    <p>
      He moved down the aisle and stood beside the seat, lifting his hat and
      looking down at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Eldridge!&rdquo; She looked up with the little peering smile and made a
      place for him among the bundles, trying to gather them up into her lap.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he swept them away. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take these,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      The little distressed look came between her eyes. Eldridge couldn&rsquo;t bear
      bundles. &ldquo;I thought I wouldn&rsquo;t wait to have them sent,&rdquo; she apologized.
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s so cold&mdash;and they need them&mdash;right off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;&rdquo; He looked at her jacket; it was thin, with the shabby lining
      showing at the edge. &ldquo;Did you get yourself a warm wrap?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was looking out of the window, and the line of her cheek flushed
      swiftly. &ldquo;No&mdash;I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want you to do it&mdash;at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She glanced at him&mdash;a little questioning look in her face. &ldquo;I&mdash;have&mdash;seen
      something I like&mdash;&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get it to-morrow. I will order it for you when I go in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her hands made a gesture above the bundles. &ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t, Eldridge. I
      would rather&mdash;do it&mdash;myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well. But remember to get it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;I will get it.&rdquo; She sighed softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Deceitful Rosalind! If he had not seen for himself the box in the attic
      with its overflowing soft colors and the grey fur, he would not have
      believed the deceit of her face....
    </p>
    <p>
      Not that he was blaming anybody. He was not blaming Rosalind. The picture
      of Mr. Eldridge Walcott remained with him.... He was not likely to forget
      how Mr. Eldridge Walcott had looked to him&mdash;in the flash of light.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps he looked like that to Rosalind&mdash;to both Rosalinds! He turned
      a little in the seat and glanced down at her&mdash;Yes, they were both
      there&mdash;the plain little figure in its shabby jacket and the reticent,
      beautiful woman of the alcove.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fingers in cheap gloves were fussing at a parcel. &ldquo;I got fleece-lined
      shirts for Tommie&mdash;his skin is so sensitive&mdash;I thought I would
      try fleece-lined ones for him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Damn fleece-lined ones! Would she never talk to him except of undershirts&mdash;and
      coal-hods? He took the paper from his pocket and glanced casually at it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has coal gone up?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;They said it would go up&mdash;if it
      stayed cold.&rdquo; The anxious, lines were in her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      He put down the paper and leaned toward her. He felt nearer to her, in a
      street car, than in his own home. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you worry about coal, Rosalind!
      We shall not freeze&mdash;nor starve.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She stared a little. &ldquo;Of course, we shall not freeze, Eldridge!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean there is plenty&mdash;to be comfortable with. You are not to worry
      and pinch.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A quick look flooded out at him&mdash;a look of the Rosalind within. &ldquo;You
      mean we can <i>afford</i> not to worry?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He saw the prig Eldridge Walcott, walking in serene knowledge of a
      comfortable income while the little lines had gathered in her face. He
      longed to kick the respectable Mr. Eldridge Walcott from behind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is quite enough money,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I am doing better than I have&mdash;and
      I shall do better yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked down at the bundles. &ldquo;I might have got a better quality,&rdquo; she
      said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take them all back,&rdquo; said Eldridge. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take them&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But she shook her head. &ldquo;No, they need them to-morrow&mdash;and these will
      do&mdash;&rdquo; She smiled at them. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s really more the feeling that you <i>can</i>
      get better ones, isn&rsquo;t it? You don&rsquo;t mind wearing old things&mdash;if you
      know you could have better ones&mdash;if you wanted to&mdash;&rdquo; She broke
      off vaguely.
    </p>
    <p>
      He saw the box in the attic&mdash;all the filmy softness&mdash;and he saw
      the ill-fitting, cheap gloves resting in her lap&mdash;That was what had
      saved her&mdash;the real Rosalind. Some one had seen that her soul should
      be in its own clothes, now and then, and happy and free. You could not
      quite be jealous of a man who had done that for you&mdash;who had clothed
      Rosalind&rsquo;s soul, could you?
    </p>
    <p>
      He could not think of the man who had clothed Rosalind&rsquo;s soul&mdash;who
      had kept alive something that was precious. He could not hate the man. But
      there was no place in his thoughts for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suppose, after all, Rosalind belonged to the man who saw her soul and
      clothed it? Suppose Rosalind belonged to him!... Very well&mdash;<i>he
      should not have her!</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      He helped her from the car with her bundles, and as he fitted the key in
      the door the wind struck them fiercely; they were almost blown in with the
      force of it as the door opened. They stood in the hall, laughing, safe&mdash;the
      wind shut out&mdash;&mdash;There was a quick color in her face, and it
      lifted to him, laughing freshly, like a girl&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were together. She had not looked at him like that for years.
    </p>
    <p>
      He pondered on the look as she went about getting supper. He watched her
      come and go and wondered awkwardly whether he might not offer to go out
      and help. He went at last into the kitchen; she was putting coal on the
      fire and he took the hod from her, throwing on the coal.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him, puzzled. &ldquo;Are you in a hurry for supper, Eldridge?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh&mdash;No.&rdquo; He went back to the living-room, and talked a little with
      the children, amusing them quietly. He had a home sense, a feeling that
      the room was a kind of presence; the wind howling outside could not touch
      them..
    </p>
    <p>
      And when Rosalind came in and they sat at the table and he looked across
      to her shyly, almost like a boy, he wished he knew what would please her
      best. He could not keep his eyes off her hand as it grasped the handle of
      the teapot and poured his tea. It seemed such a mysterious hand with the
      roughened finger pricks&mdash;and the little gentle hand inside that did
      no work. He wanted to take the hand, to touch it.... Of course, a man
      would not take his wife&rsquo;s hand&mdash;like that. He could see the startled
      look in Rosalind&rsquo;s eyes if he should reach out.... There was a long road
      to travel&mdash;and he did not know the way.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he could begin softly with clothes&mdash;and touch her hand later
      perhaps. She should have beautiful things&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;He had told
      her to buy the fur-lined coat.
    </p>
    <p>
      He pictured her in it&mdash;the coat that <i>his</i> money should buy&mdash;he
      saw her wrapped in it, and he sat still thinking of her and of the coat
      his money should buy. Then the door opened and he looked up.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was standing in the door&mdash;and about her was a long grey coat
      lined with fur&mdash;the coat of the alcove. Her eyes looked at him over
      the soft fur of the collar.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sprang to his feet&mdash;then he checked the word on his lip.
    </p>
    <p>
      He must not let her speak. It was the coat of the alcove. She would wear
      it silently. But she would not tell him. She must not be frightened into
      saying something that was not true. He came over to her and touched the
      edge of the fur, as if questioning it, and she smiled and opened it out.
      &ldquo;Is it warm enough?&rdquo; she asked proudly.
    </p>
    <p>
      She stood with the garment extended like wings, and he held his breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she drew it together softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have had it some time,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I was keeping it to surprise you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His breath came quick. How much would she tell him? He looked at it
      critically. &ldquo;Was it a bargain?&rdquo; he asked..
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;Not a bargain.&rdquo; And she stroked the edge of the fur. &ldquo;I saw it
      and liked it&mdash;and I got it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. That&rsquo;s the way to buy all your clothes.&rdquo; He looked at it a
      minute lightly and turned away.
    </p>
    <p>
      She could not have guessed from his gesture that he was disappointed, but
      her eyes followed him. &ldquo;I hope you won&rsquo;t think I paid too much&mdash;for
      it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did you pay?&rdquo; he asked. His back was toward her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I paid&mdash;two hundred dollars,&rdquo; she said. The words came lightly, and
      there was a little pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t think that was too much.&rdquo; He had turned and was looking at
      her&mdash;straight. &ldquo;I would have paid more than two hundred&mdash;to give
      it to you,&rdquo; he said slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      She made no reply, but her eyes regarded him gravely over the edge of the
      collar. Wrapped in the coat, she seemed for a moment the woman of the
      alcove.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked at her blindly.
    </p>
    <p>
      She returned the look a minute&mdash;and turned away slowly and went out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eldridge walked to the table and stood looking down.... He had given her,
      in all, not more than two hundred and fifty dollars. Did she expect him&mdash;to
      believe&mdash;that all the things that had come into the house since had
      not cost more than fifty dollars?
    </p>
    <p>
      It was as if she flaunted it at him&mdash;as if she wanted him to know
      that it could not have been <i>his</i> money that bought it!... So that
      was it! She had seen&mdash;she had guessed the change in him&mdash;and
      this was her guard? She would force him to know&mdash;to accuse her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Barstow&rsquo;s words came to him mockingly: &ldquo;No&mdash;she will not contest
      it. She wants&mdash;to be&mdash;free.&rdquo;

      him to know she gave no other sign.
    </p>
    <p>
      She spent the money that he gave her, and when it was gone she asked him
      for more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only once she had said as she took it: &ldquo;You are sure it is right for me to
      spend this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he had replied: &ldquo;When you ask for anything I cannot give you I will
      let you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had said nothing. She had not even glanced at him. But somehow he
      fancied that she understood him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He grew to know, by intuition, the days when she would go to Merwin&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he left the house he would say: &ldquo;She will be there&mdash;&rdquo; And when he
      dropped in, in the afternoon, he did not even need to glance at the alcove
      on the right. He would sit down quietly in his place across the aisle,
      glad to be with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      He never saw her come and go and he did not know whether any one was with
      her&mdash;behind her curtain. He tried not to know.... He was trying to
      understand Rosalind. What was it drew her? Was it music&mdash;or the quiet
      place? Or was there&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;?
    </p>
    <p>
      He could easily have known.... Gordon Barstow&rsquo;s detective would have made
      sure for him in a day.... But Eldridge did not want to know&mdash;anything
      that a detective could tell him. He did not want to be told by detectives
      or told things detectives could tell. He was studying Rosalind&rsquo;s every
      wish&mdash;as if he were a boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not go to Merwin&rsquo;s till he felt sure that she would be there in the
      alcove, and he left before she drew the little curtain and came out. He
      did not want to know.... He only wanted her to be there&mdash;and to sit
      with her a little while, quietly....
    </p>
    <p>
      He would wait and understand.
    </p>
    <p>
      A piano had come into the house and the boys were taking lessons. One day
      he discovered that Rosalind was learning, too.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had come home early, wondering whether he would ask her to go for a
      walk with him. He had asked her once or twice and they had gone for a
      little while before supper, walking aimlessly through the suburban
      streets, saying very little; he had fancied that Rosalind liked it&mdash;but
      he could not be sure.
    </p>
    <p>
      He opened the door with his latchkey and stepped in. Some one was playing
      softly, stopping to sing a little, and then playing again.... Rosalind was
      alone.
    </p>

    <p>
      He stood very quiet in the dark hall; only a little light from above the
      door&mdash;shining on the stair rail and on a lamp that hung above it....
      She was playing with the lightest touch&mdash;a few notes, as if feeling
      her way, and then the little singing voice answering it.... So she was
      like this&mdash;very still and happy&mdash;and he was shut out. His hand
      groped behind him for the latch and found it and opened the door, and he
      stepped outside and closed the door softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood a moment in the wind. Behind his door he heard the music playing
      to itself....
    </p>
    <p>
      He walked for a long time that afternoon&mdash;along the dull streets,
      staring at brick houses and at children running past him on brick
      walks.... It was all brick walks and long rows of houses&mdash;and
      dulness; he could not reach Rosalind. He could buy clothes for her&mdash;more
      bricks... and there was the music&mdash;his mind halted&mdash;and went on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Music made her happy&mdash;like that! He bought an evening paper and
      studied it awhile, standing by the newsstand, with the cars and taxis
      shooting past. Presently he folded the paper and took a car that was going
      toward town. There was something he could do for Rosalind&mdash;something
      that no one had thought of&mdash;something that she would like!
    </p>
    <p>
      He was as eager and as ignorant as a boy, standing in front of the barred
      ticket window and looking in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tickets for the Symphony?&rdquo; The man glanced out at him. &ldquo;House sold out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Eldridge stared back. &ldquo;You mean&mdash;I cannot&mdash;get them!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Something may come in. You can leave your name.&rdquo; The man pushed paper and
      pencil toward him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eldridge wrote his name slowly. &ldquo;I want&mdash;good ones.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t say&mdash;&rdquo; said the man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are six ahead of you&mdash;&rdquo; He took up the paper and made a note.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eldridge stepped outside. A man looked at him and moved up, falling into
      step beside him. &ldquo;I have a couple of tickets&mdash;&rdquo; he said softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not know that he was speaking to a man on a quest, a man who would
      have paid whatever he might ask for the slips of paper in his hand&mdash;They
      were not mere symphony tickets he sold. They were tickets to the fields of
      the sun. He asked five dollars for them; he might have got fifty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eldridge slipped them into his pocket. He stepped back into the hall. &ldquo;I
      shall not need those tickets,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man in the window glanced at him, indifferent, and crossed out a name.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the way home Eldridge&rsquo;s heart laughed. Would she like it?... She had
      played so softly... she would listen like that&mdash;and he would be with
      her.... He could not keep the tickets in his pocket. He took them out and
      looked at them&mdash;two plain blue slips with a few black marks on
      them.... And he had thought of it himself!&mdash;It was not Mr. El-dridge
      Walcott&rsquo;s money that bought them for her.... Would she understand it was
      not money&mdash;?
    </p>
    <p>
      She took them from him with half-pleased face&mdash;&ldquo;For the Symphony?&rdquo;
       she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought you might&mdash;we&mdash;. might like it&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked at them a minute. &ldquo;I never went to a symphony&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor I&mdash;&rdquo; He laughed a little. &ldquo;I thought we might&mdash;try it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was still regarding them thoughtfully. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t anything to wear&mdash;have
      I&mdash;?&rdquo; She looked up with the wrinkled line between her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wear your&mdash;&rdquo; He checked it on his tongue. &ldquo;Get something&mdash;There&rsquo;s
      a week, you know. You can get something, can&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, if you think I ought&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course&mdash;get what you need.&rdquo; She waited thoughtfully.... &ldquo;I have&mdash;a
      dress that might do&mdash;with a little changing&mdash;&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      He saw with a flash, suddenly, the dark attic above them&mdash;and a man
      on his knees staring down at the grey and shimmering whiteness. &ldquo;Better
      get something new, wouldn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; said Eldridge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps&mdash;I will think&mdash;about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He could not have told which he wished&mdash;&mdash;-But when, the night
      of the concert, she came down to him wearing the grey dress and long grey
      gloves, with the lace falling softly back&mdash;he knew in the flash, as
      he looked at her, that he was glad....
    </p>
    <p>
      She was buttoning one of the gloves and the long grey coat hung from her
      arm. She did not look up.
    </p>
    <p>
      He took it from her and wrapped her in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were going to another world&mdash;together. She was going&mdash;with
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a little, quiet flush in her face as she sat in the car. Other
      people were going to the concert, and she looked at them as they came in
      and sat down.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Eldridge looked at Rosalind. He did not speak to her.... They were
      going to a new world&mdash;and the car was taking them.... Bits of talk&mdash;color&mdash;drifting
      fragrance as the coats fell back.... The woman across the aisle had a
      bunch of violets....
    </p>
    <p>
      Why had he not thought to get violets for Rosalind! Would she have liked
      flowers&mdash;? She seemed a strange Rosalind, sitting beside him in the
      car in her grey dress&mdash;her eyes like little stars.... They had three
      children... and a brick house....
    </p>
    <p>
      The car jolted on. Eldridge would have wished that it might never stop....
      There would not be another night like this. He could put out his hand and
      touch mystery.... Then he was helping her over the crowded street and they
      were in the hall&mdash;with flowers everywhere&mdash;and something close
      about you that touched you when you moved.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      For years afterward he looked back to that Symphony with Rosalind. He had
      come blindly to a door&mdash;as blindly as, when a boy, he had walked in
      the moonlight&mdash;and they had gone in together. They were like children
      in its strangeness. And as children explore a new field, they went
      forward. It belonged to them&mdash;the lights and people, and vibrations
      everywhere.... They would go till they came to the end&mdash;but there
      would be no end&mdash;always hills stretching beyond, and a wood&mdash;something
      deep, mysterious in that wood.... They came to it softly, looking in, and
      turned back.... Once Rosalind had turned and looked at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He held that fast&mdash;through the weeks and months that went by, through
      the dull brick streets, he held it fast&mdash;for a moment the hidden
      Rosalind had come to her window and looked out at him and smiled&mdash;before
      she turned away.

      XI
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HE next day Gordon
      Barstow had come to see him. The divorce had dragged on. It had not been
      contested, but there had been delays and consultations and Eldridge had
      come to know Gordon Barstow well.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had a kind of keen, vicarious pity for Barstow. Sometimes, as he talked
      with him and the simple lovableness of the man&rsquo;s nature came up through
      the uncouthness, he wondered whether Gordon Barstow might not have
      regained his wife&mdash;if he had been determined. But he had let her go;
      and after the first day he had seemed to take a kind of pleasure in the
      proceedings.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been foolish about her,&rdquo; he said, sitting in Eldridge&rsquo;s office. &ldquo;But
      I don&rsquo;t want her to suffer because I&rsquo;ve been foolish&mdash;and I want to
      make her an allowance&mdash;a good one. I don&rsquo;t want Cordelia should ever
      be poor.&rdquo; Eldridge looked at him. &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t Tower take care of that?&rdquo; he
      suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old man seemed to hold it&mdash;&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll mean to. He&rsquo;s honest toward
      her. I shouldn&rsquo;t let him marry her if he wasn&rsquo;t straight. But I want
      Cordelia provided for.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Eldridge suddenly saw that he was thinking of her as a man thinks of
      his daughter&mdash;protectingly. The soreness seemed to have gone out of
      his hurt. And there was something big in his attitude toward the two who
      had wronged him. &ldquo;Cordelia&rsquo;s only a child,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe I&rsquo;d
      &rsquo;a&rsquo; minded so much&mdash;if they&rsquo;d trusted me. It&rsquo;s that that hurts, I
      guess&mdash;thinking of the times they must &rsquo;a&rsquo; lied&mdash;and I not
      knowing enough to see anything was wrong.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Yes&mdash;it was that that hurt&mdash;the times Rosalind had slipped away
      from him, before he knew&mdash;when he hadn&rsquo;t eyes enough to see. He did
      not mind that she went to Merwin&rsquo;s. Sometimes he was impatient that she
      did not go oftener. He would watch eagerly for the look in her face that
      told him that to-day was a Merwin day.... He did not mind her going, now
      that he knew. It was the not knowing that hurt.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes, lately, he had begun to wonder whether Rosalind knew that he
      was there, whether she guessed who it was that came through the swinging
      doors and sat across the aisle, always a little behind her, and went away
      before she left her place.... He liked to fancy that she knew&mdash;and
      did not mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Men and women were not so small as he had made them in his thought. There
      was room in them generally for life to turn round.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was this that Gordon Barstow had taught him, he thought. He watched the
      old man&rsquo;s simple preparations to make Cordelia &ldquo;well off&rdquo; with quiet
      understanding. It was not reparation with him; it was only a steady, clear
      intention in the old man&rsquo;s thought that the woman he had loved and who had
      gone from him should not suffer.... &ldquo;I might have kept her&mdash;if I&rsquo;d
      understood quick enough, I guess. I&rsquo;m slow&mdash;about women,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then one day he came into the office. Eldridge had sent him word that
      there were last papers to sign&mdash;and the business would be done. He
      came in slowly, a little pinched with the cold. The wart in the grey-black
      beard had a bluish look. Eldridge had learned not to look at the
      half-hidden lump of flesh. He had fancied one day, as his eye rested on
      it, that the man shrank a little. He had been surprised and he had never
      looked at it again. It was the curious bluish look to-day that caught his
      eye an instant.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old man signed the papers and pushed them back. &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m glad&mdash;it&rsquo;s
      done.&rdquo; He sat looking at them a minute. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s taught me more than I ever
      knew before,&rdquo; he said. He lifted his eyes a minute to Eldridge. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
      learned things&mdash;thinking about it&mdash;and about her&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He sat without speaking a little time. He had come to trust Eldridge, and
      he seemed to like to sit quiet like this, at times, without speaking. &ldquo;I
      saw a woman to-day,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that made me understand&mdash;more than
      Cordelia has&mdash;a woman in at Merwins.&rdquo;&mdash;Eldridge leaned forward&mdash;&ldquo;She
      was sitting there alone,&rdquo; said the old man, &ldquo;and I see her face&mdash;one
      of these quiet faces&mdash;not old and not young. I could &rsquo;a&rsquo; loved her if
      I&rsquo;d known her when I was younger&mdash;I see how she was&mdash;she sat so
      quiet there. Well&rdquo;&mdash;he got up and reached for his hat&mdash;&ldquo;you&rsquo;ve
      seen me through. Thank you&mdash;for what you&rsquo;ve done.&rdquo; And then he went
      out and Eldridge looked at his watch&mdash;Too late. She would be gone. It
      was the first time he had missed her&mdash;since he knew. He had not
      thought that Barstow&rsquo;s business would take so long. He gathered up the
      papers, filing certain ones and addressing others to be mailed.... He
      should miss the old man. He had a feeling underneath his thought, as he
      sorted the papers and filed them, that he was glad Barstow had sat so long
      even though he had missed Rosalind.... He had seemed to want to stay.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eldridge filed the last of the papers and looked again at his watch. It
      was late, but not too late, he decided, to begin the piece of work that
      had been put off for nearly a week. He became absorbed in it, and it was
      seven o&rsquo;clock before he left the office.
    </p>
    <p>
      The newsboys were shouting extras&mdash;as he came out&mdash;and he put
      one in his pocket. He did not open it. Some one took a seat by him in the
      car and they talked till the car reached home. Then the children claimed
      him; and after supper he talked a little while with Rosalind.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a maid now in the kitchen and Rosalind&rsquo;s hands, he was thinking,
      as they lay in her lap, were not red and roughened; they had a delicate
      look. She sat sometimes without any sewing in them or any fussy work&mdash;talking
      with him or sitting quiet. The first time she had sat so, without
      speaking, he had felt as if the silence were calling out&mdash;shouting
      his happiness&mdash;telling the world that Rosalind trusted him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He opened the paper and glanced at it&mdash;and dropped it&mdash;as if he
      were seeing something.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked up. &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      He took it up again slowly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a man&mdash;I know&mdash;Gordon Barstow.
      They found him dead&mdash;in his car this afternoon. It&rsquo;s some one you
      never knew.&rdquo;

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>EEKS passed and
      she had not gone to Merwin&rsquo;s. For a while Eldridge watched her face and
      waited for the Merwin look to come.... Then he forgot it&mdash;for weeks
      he did not think of it. There had been another concert; they had gone to a
      play and then to another; and as the spring came on he took her for long
      drives into the country; sometimes they went with the children, but more
      often alone. They drove far out in the country and came back at early
      dusk, the brick houses softly outlined about them.
    </p>
    <p>
      She could not fail to see that he was devoted to her. Sometimes he brought
      a flower and left it on her table; he never gave it to her directly, and
      there was no response to it. Beyond the one quiet look at the concert, she
      had given no sign&mdash;only that now she would sit with him silent, a
      long time, as if she did not repel him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was working hard and the business had grown. A new class of clients was
      coming to him&mdash;men with big interests&mdash;and the work often kept
      him late at the office. Sometimes he would take supper in town and work
      far into the evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was late in June that he came home one night and found her sitting
      alone in the porch&mdash;a shadowy figure&mdash;as he came up the brick
      walk.
    </p>
    <p>
      The day had been warm, but the air had grown cool now and the moon
      glimmered over the houses and roofs and on the few trees and shrubs in the
      yard.
    </p>
    <p>
      They sat a long time in the porch, talking of the children and of the work
      he had stayed for and a little about going away for the summer; they had
      never been away in the summer, but they were going next week. He had tried
      to send her earlier, when the children were through school, but she had
      waited, and he had arranged for them all to get away together.
    </p>
    <p>
      The moon rose high over the roofs and picked out the little lines of vines
      on the porch and touched her face and hair. She was wearing a light dress,
      something filmy, that was half in shadow, and his eyes traced the lines of
      it. She was always mysterious, but often now as he looked at her he felt
      that her guard was down. There were only a few steps more to cross&mdash;he
      began to wonder if he should ever take them&mdash;to-night perhaps? Or was
      he not, after all, the man to win her?
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not hold him back. It was something in him that waited. He
      watched, through the moonlight, the vine shadows on her face&mdash;and he
      remembered the night when she lay asleep&mdash;and he had watched her face&mdash;the
      stranger&rsquo;s face&mdash;close to him... and a boy and girl stood in the
      moonlight and looked at him mistily&mdash;and drew back&mdash;and his wife
      swayed a little, rocking in her chair, and her shadow moved on the
      floor....
    </p>
    <p>
      If he should speak&mdash;to her&mdash;now&mdash;what would she do? Would
      the gentle rocking cease?...
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, slowly, a face grew before him. He watched it shape and fade&mdash;with
      its grimness and kindness and a look of pain that lay behind it&mdash;old
      Barstow&rsquo;s face!... He knew now&mdash;he had come out of the moonlight....
      To-morrow he would speak to Rosalind&mdash;face to face, in the clear
      light of every day.... The wonder of life was hidden in the sun&mdash;not
      in half lights&mdash;or moonlight.... He was not afraid now. They would go
      for a long drive&mdash;and he would tell her in the sun.
    </p>
    <p>
      But when he looked at her in the morning he knew that he was not to take
      her with him out into the country. It was the Merwin look&mdash;a little
      look of quiet intentness as if she dreamed and would not wake....
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked at it and turned away. He had not seen the look for weeks, but
      he knew that he should find her there when he pushed open the swinging
      doors and went in.
    </p>
    <p>
      The curtains were drawn a little back and he knew, before he sat down,
      that she was there&mdash;waiting for some one.... He had never seen her
      like this&mdash;he had not been sure. He had put the thought from him when
      it came. But now he knew&mdash;she was there waiting for some one, full of
      happiness.... He knew her so well! She could not have a happiness he did
      not share&mdash;and no one should hurt her! His hands half clinched.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had not thought she would come&mdash;again.... Why had she come? And
      this was <i>his</i> day&mdash;under the sky!... He had not thought this
      day she would come to Merwin&rsquo;s!
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he waited with her. Whatever Rosalind chose&mdash;she should not
      separate herself from him&mdash;or from love.... He would wait with her
      and be glad with her.... The strange face&mdash;the moonlight face&mdash;did
      not shut him out now....
    </p>
    <p>
      The swinging doors opened and closed and the man and the woman waited.
    </p>
    <p>
      The curtains to her alcove were closed; she had reached a hand to them and
      drawn them together.... But she could not shut herself away; he could see
      her as clearly as if he were there with her&mdash;the bent head and gentle
      face. The curtains should not shut him out.
    </p>
    <p>
      He could not have told when it was that it came to him&mdash;He lifted his
      head a minute and looked at it.... She was there waiting for some one&mdash;she
      had been waiting, a long time, in her alcove&mdash;and he had not stirred!
    </p>
    <p>
      He got up slowly and looked across to the green curtain&mdash;He moved
      toward it&mdash;and put out his hand and&mdash;drew back the curtain....
      She was looking up, smiling&mdash;&ldquo;You were&mdash;a long time!&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her hand motioned to the seat across the table&mdash;but he did not take
      it. He stood looking down at her&mdash;He laid his hat on the table and
      bent and kissed her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her lip trembled a little but she did not speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat down in the chair opposite and looked at her&mdash;&mdash;-&ldquo;Well&mdash;?&rdquo;
       he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      She shook the tears from her eyes and smiled through them. &ldquo;It was a long
      while!&rdquo; she said.

    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HE man and the
      woman in the alcove on the right had been talking a long while. Three
      times the waiter had looked in and withdrawn. If he had stopped long
      enough he would have seen that it seemed to be the woman who was talking.
      The man sat silent, one hand shading his eyes and the eyes looking out at
      her as she talked.
    </p>
    <p>
      The waiter knew the woman. He had served her&mdash;many times. He
      remembered very well the first day she came to Merwin&rsquo;s&mdash;a year ago&mdash;more
      than a year, perhaps. She was alone, and she had stood just inside the
      swinging door&mdash;looking about her as if she were not used to places
      like Merwin&rsquo;s&mdash;or as if she were afraid. Something had made him think
      that she was looking for some one&mdash;and he had shown her into the
      third alcove on the right. But no one had come that day. She had come
      again many times since, and always alone, and there was always a coin on
      the table in the third alcove waiting for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The waiter was a little disappointed to-day.... He knew the man&mdash;Eldridge
      Walcott&mdash;a lawyer&mdash;a good enough sort; but the waiter somehow
      felt that they had not met until today. He had served them both alone&mdash;but
      not together&mdash;until to-day.... He pushed aside the curtain and looked
      in.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was still talking.... The man made a little gesture of refusal, and he
      withdrew....
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was when Tom sent me the five hundred&mdash;&rdquo; the waiter heard her say
      as the curtain fell in place.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man in the alcove behind the curtain was looking at her&mdash;&ldquo;When
      did Tom send you&mdash;five hundred?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A year ago&mdash;a little more than a year, I think&mdash;&rdquo; She paused to
      think it out. &ldquo;He had not sent us anything, you know&mdash;not since
      little Tom was born&mdash;?&rdquo; She was looking at him, straight&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      His own look did not flinch. &ldquo;I know&mdash;I put it into the business&mdash;called
      it investing it&mdash;for Tommie&mdash;at six per cent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She nodded. &ldquo;Tom never liked it. I suppose mother told him&mdash;that we
      had not used it to buy things with&mdash;the way he meant us to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For things you needed,&rdquo; said the man. &ldquo;I know&mdash;I knew then&mdash;but
      I took it.&rdquo; He did not excuse himself&mdash;and his eyes did not look away
      from her. &ldquo;I was blind,&rdquo; he said softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was what Tom wrote&mdash;when he sent the five hundred. He said that
      I must spend it on myself&mdash;or return it to him.... And that I was to
      tell him just what I bought with it&mdash;every penny of it&mdash;&rdquo; She
      waited a minute.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did he say anything else?&rdquo; asked the man. &ldquo;Better tell me everything,
      wouldn&rsquo;t you&mdash;Rosalind?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He said that he was not setting Eldridge Walcott up in business,&rdquo; she
      added after a little minute&mdash;and she smiled at him tenderly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eldridge returned the look&mdash;&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t mind&mdash;now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;... They were silent a few minutes. &ldquo;I thought&mdash;at first&mdash;I
      <i>would</i> send it back. I wrote to Tom how many things we needed&mdash;for
      the house&mdash;and the children&mdash;and for everything&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did he say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He asked me if you would <i>let</i> me spend it for the house and for the
      children and for everything&mdash;if you knew about it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man&rsquo;s eyes were looking at Mr. Eldridge Walcott, regarding him
      impartially. &ldquo;I am glad that you did not let me know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. I sent it back&mdash;once. But Tom wrote again&mdash;all about when
      we were children and when he gave me the biggest bites of candy and filled
      my pail up to the top when we went berrying&mdash;&mdash;-He said it was
      what had made a man of him&mdash;keeping my pail full.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Eldridge winced a little. But she did not stop. &ldquo;He said he wanted me to
      spend the money for the little girl <i>he</i> knew.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t spend it&mdash;not for a long time, you know. But I kept it and
      I looked at it&mdash;sometimes&mdash;and wondered.... Then one day I saw a
      dress&mdash;that I liked. I thought it was like me, a little&mdash;?&rdquo; She
      looked at him&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      He nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I got it&mdash;and that was the end, I guess.&rdquo; She laughed
      tremulously. &ldquo;Everything kept coming after that. The dress seemed to make
      me need&mdash; <i>everything!</i>&rdquo; She spread out her hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she sat thinking&mdash;and looking at the dress that needed
      everything. &ldquo;I wore it at first just at home&mdash;when I was alone. I
      would put it on and sit down and fold my hands&mdash;and think of
      things... about Tom and about being a little girl&mdash;and about mother.
      I was always rested when I took it off... and when the children came in
      from school and you came home, I could bear things better.&rdquo;....
    </p>
    <p>
      He reached out a hand and touched hers where it lay on the table.... He
      had said that he should touch it&mdash;some time. He stroked it a minute
      and she went on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I came here&mdash;&rdquo; She made a little gesture. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know what
      it was like&mdash;I didn&rsquo;t even know there was a place like this.&rdquo; She
      glanced around the alcove that sheltered them&mdash;with its folds of
      green curtain&mdash;&ldquo;But as soon as I came, I knew I should come again. I
      knew it would take care of me&mdash;the way Tom wanted for me. So I spent
      the money.&rdquo; She lifted the little linked purse from the table&mdash;she
      laughed. &ldquo;Only fifty cents left&mdash;You &rsquo;re here just in time!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Eldridge held out his hand. &ldquo;Give it to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want it&mdash;yes. Aren&rsquo;t you willing to give me fifty cents&mdash;of
      your five hundred?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She handed it to him with a little sigh of relief.
    </p>
    <p>
      He took it and balanced it thoughtfully in his hand&mdash;&ldquo;Why did you
      come to-day?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is my anniversary day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-day?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She nodded&mdash;as if she saw a vision. &ldquo;It is a year to-day that I came
      here&mdash;the first time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alone&mdash;?&rdquo; The word breathed itself&mdash;and stopped, and Eldridge
      put out a hand. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell me! I did not ask it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know?&rdquo; She was looking at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I know. I do not understand&mdash;but I know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She smiled and sat silent.... &ldquo;I was frightened to come!&rdquo; It seemed as if
      she were looking at the strangeness of it. &ldquo;I was afraid&mdash;the first
      day&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You should have asked me to come,&rdquo; he urged.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you have come?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;not then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I had to come! I could not wait&mdash;and there was&mdash;no one....
      You would not have come&mdash;not even if I had waited.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;I should not have come&mdash;except to find you.... Tell me,
      have you never been afraid of me&mdash;of what I would do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The first day&mdash;yes&mdash;I was terribly frightened when you came in
      and sat over there,&rdquo; she moved her hand. &ldquo;I wanted to scream out&mdash;to
      go to you and tell you what it meant, and beg you not to be angry.... I
      had never done anything without you before. I was like a child! Then you
      went out and I hurried home. I tore off the things. I did not mind your
      knowing. I only wanted you to understand. I was afraid you might not&mdash;understand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;I know. But after a while&mdash;I knew you were trying to....
      Then I knew that some day we should be here&mdash;together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The little alcove seemed to expand and become a wide place&mdash;Eldridge
      caught a glimpse of something fine and sincere&mdash;it passed like a
      breath over her face and was gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      She lifted the face&mdash;&ldquo;I have waited for it,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I have prayed
      for it every day, I think.&rdquo; Her lips barely moved the words&mdash;&ldquo;I did
      not want to feel alone here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He pushed back the curtain and beckoned to the waiter. &ldquo;We will drink to
      the day,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eldridge gave his order and looked on, smiling, while the waiter placed
      the slender-necked flask on the table and brought out the glasses and
      withdrew.
    </p>
    <p>
      They lifted the glasses. &ldquo;To the day&mdash;you left me,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;And to
      the day I followed you,&rdquo; he added slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The glass paused in her hand. &ldquo;That was the Symphony&mdash;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;And to your anniversary!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She set down the glass. &ldquo;I have not told you everything. It was not&mdash;my
      anniversary&mdash;made me come&mdash;to-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She shook her head. &ldquo;I came&mdash;to meet&mdash;you!&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked at her slowly&mdash;&ldquo;And when did you know that I would come?&rdquo;
       he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Last night&mdash;in the moonlight. I was so afraid you would speak there&mdash;in
      the moon! I did not want the moon to get in,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I wanted you to
      speak in real, plain daylight&mdash;and then, of course, you know, it&rsquo;s
      Tom&rsquo;s gown and not the moon. Everybody has the moon!&rdquo; she laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is a very little place, this alcove,&rdquo; said Eldridge. He was looking
      about him at the green walls of the alcove&mdash;thinking of the sun and
      the fields and of the road up through the hills&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s where I went berrying with Tom,&rdquo; she laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      He smiled at her. &ldquo;Then it is as big as the world&mdash;and the sun and
      all the fields of the sun!&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Outside the curtain the music tinkled dimly, and there was a lower music
      still of all the glasses and words&mdash;and there was a silence in the
      alcove.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So there has never been any one&mdash;any one but me&mdash;&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;in
      your alcove!&rdquo; He was looking at her hap-pily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo; Her lip waited on it&mdash;and closed. &ldquo;There <i>was</i> some one&mdash;&rdquo;
       she spoke slowly. &ldquo;It seems a queer thing to tell. It had no beginning and
      no end!&rdquo; She waited, still looking at it.... &ldquo;It was a man&mdash;an old
      man&mdash;that used to sit over there to the left, at a table by himself.
      I could see him through the curtains. Even when they were almost closed I
      could see him. He always sat there, and always alone.... I did not notice
      him at first.... I do not think any one would have noticed him&mdash;at
      first. He was almost ugly&mdash;or he seemed ugly.&rdquo; She was smiling at her
      thought.... &ldquo;And one day suddenly I saw him as he really was, as he was
      inside&mdash;very gentle and strong and wise&mdash;and not wanting to hurt
      any one or to let any one suffer&mdash;more than they had to. I knew, some
      way, if I should go up to him and speak to him, that he would understand
      me&mdash;and help me. I should have liked to&mdash;speak to him. Of course
      it is really the same as if I did.&rdquo;... She seemed thinking of it. &ldquo;But I
      didn&rsquo;t. I never saw him more than a dozen times, I suppose. But I used to
      think about him, and it helped me. I should have trusted him anywhere&mdash;and
      been willing to go with him&mdash;anywhere in the world. I don&rsquo;t believe
      he was very clever&mdash;but it rested me to think of him&mdash;just as a
      big, homely field rests you&mdash;and the way the music did that first
      night&mdash;when we knew each other&mdash;&mdash;-&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After a minute she went on. &ldquo;I have not seen him for a long time. He
      stopped coming suddenly....&rdquo;

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm

and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

1.B. &ldquo;Project Gutenberg&rdquo; is a registered trademark. It may only be

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work

phrase &ldquo;Project Gutenberg&rdquo; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you&rsquo;ll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &ldquo;Project
Gutenberg&rdquo; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply

trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted

will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than &ldquo;Plain Vanilla ASCII&rdquo; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means

  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, &ldquo;Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation.&rdquo;

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &ldquo;Defects,&rdquo; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &ldquo;Right
of Replacement or Refund&rdquo; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &rsquo;AS-IS&rsquo;, WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm&rsquo;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation&rsquo;s EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state&rsquo;s laws.

The Foundation&rsquo;s principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
